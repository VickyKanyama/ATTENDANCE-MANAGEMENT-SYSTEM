# ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
#In this code there are concepts such as: encapsulation, abstractions, inheritance, polymorphism.

#Attendance management system is mostly about automating the pen and paper attendance process.
#We have the attendance class as the abstract class which is also the parent class which has children classes derived from it.
#Attendance class has fields like AdmissionNumber,sName which is Student's name this shall automatically be derived by the subclasses.
 #Subclasses are:
               1.Course
               2.Unit
               3.Lecturer
               4.Hours
#We have methods to get Unit Name , Student name,AdmissionNumber among others
# We have the assumption that the lecturer or student logins to the system , inserts their ID Number or Admission Number and their passwords.Lecturer can update the attendance however students can only view the attendance.
#The hours class shows classes where the student was present and where they were absent.
#The login class has methods where attendance can be updated and attendance percentage can be calculated.
#The system's main shortcoming was we were unable to create the GUI that could have made users understand the system better.
